=============================Introduction============================================
  This is a simple doctor patient appointment system website which is written in 
  php.
========================Important ports and settings===================================
  according to my system i configure it on 8080 port so
configure each file according to it especially 'impFunction.php' in this file
 i have defined function to redirect to one page to another page so instead of
'localhost:8080' use 'localhost' or as your requirement.Although this was my first
project which is big for me obviously not for others so i you will find that file 
structure is very poor so bear with it.

===========================Database settings==========================================
i have attached cure.sql file which has all the settings of database so just create
database and import tables from this file.
There is db.php file for your reliablity use the database name same as in the db.php
as i mentioned above file structure is very poor so i have created same file
db.php may be twice or thrice same thing happened with impFunction.php but i included
all files so don't delete any file.
So go to db.php and change setting if you find there is two or three files which name
is db.php change all don't delete any file i repeat don't delete.
==============================Not mobile responsive==================================
This website is for Desktop.This is not responsive or good looking on mobile.Obviously
you can use this on any mobile but it will look horrible!! sorry for that.
